It also provides Decentralized Identifier (DID) tokens for identity verification.  \n\n2. **What is the difference between a dApp and a traditional app?**  \nA dApp (decentralized application) operates on a peer-to-peer network, such as a blockchain, and is not controlled by a single entity. It offers transparency, security, and resilience against censorship. In contrast, traditional apps are typically hosted on centralized servers, which can lead to single points of failure and less transparency.  \n\n3. **How does the smart contract deployment process work?**  \nUsers can choose from a list of available contracts to deploy. The process varies based on network traffic and the content of the contract.  \n\n4. **What types of legal contracts can I deploy?**  \nOur dApp supports a variety of legal contracts, including agreements, leases, and more. Users can customize their contracts based on their specific needs.  \n\n5. **How are digital signatures implemented?**  \nDigital signatures are generated using cryptographic techniques that verify the authenticity of the parties involved in the contract. Each signatory receives a unique digital signature linked to their identity.  \n\n6. **What are DID tokens, and how do they work?**  \nDID tokens are cryptographic identifiers that provide users with a unique digital identity. They allow users to control their personal information and prove their identity in a decentralized manner.  \n\n7. **Are my contracts secure?**  \nYes, all contracts deployed through our dApp are stored on the blockchain, making them secure and tamper-proof. The use of digital signatures further enhances security.  \n\n8. **Do I need any prior knowledge of blockchain to use this dApp?**  \nNo, our dApp is designed to be user-friendly and requires no prior knowledge of blockchain technology. We provide an intuitive interface to guide you through the process.  \n\n9. **How do I get started?**  \nSimply create an account, and follow the onboarding process to create and deploy your legal contracts. You will also receive your DID tokens during this process.  \n\n10. **Is there a cost associated with deploying contracts?**  \nThere is no limit to the number of business contracts you can deploy; it depends on your account charges. If you can pay for deployment, you can deploy as many contracts as you want.  \n\n11. **What happens if I lose access to my DID tokens?**  \nIf you lose the DID of your token, you will lose all access to it, as it serves as the pointer to your contract.  \n\n12. **Can I edit or revoke a contract after deployment?**  \nSome contracts can be updated by the controller's account defined by the contract issuer.  \n\n13. **How does the dApp handle data privacy and user information?**  \nOur service follows GDPR standards, storing no sensitive information except for account details like username and account charges. Sensitive information such as wallet data and deployment details is stored locally. Error and crash data of the app are logged, and we use Firebase Authentication, which has its own terms.  \n\n14. **Are there any legal implications of using smart contracts?**  \nWe do not have any access to the contracts; only the issuers have access to them, and the content must not violate laws.  \n\n15. **Can I integrate this dApp with other services or platforms?**  \nNo, the app does not provide any public or external API for interaction and will not interact with external wallets, as it has its own internal encrypted wallet.  \n\n16. **What happens if I lose my contract ID?**  \nLosing your contract ID will result in losing access to the contract, so it is essential to save it in other secure places to prevent loss.  \n\n17. **How does interaction with smart contracts work?**  \nInteraction with smart contracts will be done directly through the client app, and our server will not interfere in these tasks.  \n\n18. **What should I know about private contract IDs?**  \nThe contract ID of private contracts must not be shared with unauthorized people, as it contains the key to decipher contract content.  \n\n19. **What are the requirements for referencing assets in contracts?**  \nFor some contracts, only IPFS CID is allowed as a reference or asset address. Users must pin their contracts or assets on pinning services and enter this information in the app, as we will not provide any storage for this.  \n\n20. **How can I provide feedback or suggest features for the dApp?** \nFeedback can be provided via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yTQyFXec8p) server or or [X](https://twitter.com/ContractFoundry)."
